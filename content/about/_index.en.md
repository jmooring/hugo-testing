## About me

Hello there. My name is Dmitry Kann (Cyrillic: {{< fl "Дмитрий Канн" >}}). I was born and bred in Russia, but in **2008** I've moved to the Netherlands, which became my new home. I live in a beautiful town called [Houten](/blog/posts/0221).

I'm a software developer and the founder of a small software company called [Yktoo Solutions](https://yktoo.solutions).

I have a number of hobbies to fill up my spare time: blogging, open-source [software development](/software), music, travelling, aikido and running. Back in the day I was a part of the [Radiolaria](/radiolaria) duo.

I speak Russian, English, and Dutch. If you feel like contacting me, check out the [Contact](/about/contact) page.

### About my blog
