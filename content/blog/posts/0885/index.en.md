The time flies like an arrow. Quite unexpectedly, it's an upshot moment again!

## War in Ukraine

This last year it's become clear the war is the new normal now. With regular shellings of Ukrainian cities and repressions on the rise inside Russia. We call it the "negative natural selection," when the meanest, the dumbest are in power, oppressing and punishing any dissent.

To an outsider's eye it doesn't make a shred of sense, that what the Russians are doing to Ukraine â€” or to their own folk for that matter. There's, however, a strong, sinister feeling there's a mighty good chance the situation will simply collapse into total chaos at some point.

<!--more-->

There's not much to do about that, anyway. And the chances are, if one waits long enough, the situation will solve on itself.

That said, none of my Russian friends gives any considerable thought to that. Their lives just go on, with their daily routines of work and entertainment. My Tyumen friends don't even care if there's any Moscow behind the Ural mountains, not to mention Ukraine or NATO.

{{< fl "De wereld draait door" >}}, as the Dutch say: the world keeps spinning nonetheless.

## Travel

### Venice

We have visited Venice, Italy, in the beginning of March. It's a magnificent little place, bustling with life, boasting of its poorly maintained yet absolutely charming houses. And â€” as we learned along the way â€” the origin of Aperol Spritz.

We also visited the islands of Burano, the place beloved by photographers for its bright, colourful houses, and Murano â€” famous for its glassware.

### Essen

We spent a weekend in April in the German Essen, taking a stroll along the banks of Ruhr and visiting the Red Dot Design Museum, which offers a great curiosity collection to see.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704018195/blog/up8dcdmkibvvxterqevl.jpg" "Red Dot Design Museum in Essen, Germany." >}}

### Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro

We went eastwards for the holidays in May â€” to see Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and Montenegro. It's tempting to add a couple hundred photos of those, but I'll refrain from that.

### Frankfurt

In June we went â€” perhaps for the hundredth time â€” to Frankfurt. Every place is beautiful in June.

### Stockholm

In July, when it's much too hot otherwise, we deliberately fled to the northern Stockholm, the capital of Sweden.

It proved a great experience, friendly English-speaking people, gorgeous architecture. We looked for the roof hut of Carlsson, a character from every Russian kid's childhood:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704019683/blog/yiuwqqelltrvwj8l32u0.jpg" "Carlsson's hut in Stockholm." >}}

Admired the famous designs of Stockholm Underground:

Wandered about the equally famous Public Library:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704019950/blog/lypfgy4hmhk1mmypudfi.jpg" "Stockholm Public Library." >}}

â€¦ and plenty of other places.

### Eindhoven

We visited Eindhoven, the birthplace of Philips, for the first time.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704020177/blog/uaumolsqcixzpwr8zk5z.jpg" "Eindhoven." >}}

### Valkenburg

Last Christmas we've finally seen the {{< fl "kerststad" >}} ("Christmas town") Valkenburg. It's mostly known for its caves and the "largest underground Christmas market in Europe." It seemed a bit overrated, yet was worth seeing once (but not more): 

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704020609/blog/sw0vqmlb5nel5xrgzjjb.jpg" "Underground Christmas market in Valkenburg." >}}

### Tenerife

Quite the opposite, we'll be celebrating the upcoming **2024** in the sunny Tenerife (one of the Canary islands), enjoying the air temperatures of **25â€¯Â°C** (**77â€¯Â°F**).

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704020955/blog/jstgjpnblbafjbjjmjaz.jpg" "Los Gigantes, Tenerife." >}}

## Sport

### Aikido

On the Fools Day, the **1**<sup>st</sup> of April, I've passed a *sandan* (third dan) Aikido Aikikai exam in Leiden. With my quite moderate pace it took me **18** years to get there (well, COVID-19 was also to blame).

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704017554/blog/kxg4hjxud7cjbeuqcyuv.jpg" "After the sandan exam." >}}

Then something unexpected happened: my sensei had a disagreement with the head of the Dutch Aikikai Foundation, just like it previously [had been](0273) with Joginder's dojo (there's apparently some pattern to it). Because of that I only got my official sandan diploma four months later, also in Leiden.

### Weight-lifting

I've been doing weight-lifting for little more than a year now in a local gym. Over the past year I've managed to improve my result in bench press from **135** up to **155Â kg** (*one repetition max*), and to **140Â kg** with a close grip. Which I personally find satisfying given my own weight (ca. **85Â kg**) and age.

### Running

I keep running regularly all the time, and my yearly mileage is **704Â km**. Not bad either, considering all other stuff that kept me busy.

## Professional

### Comentario

In the beginning of {{< year 2023 "this year" >}} I got so annoyed by Commento's bugs I started a new fork, which I called [Comentario](/software/comentario). In April it's seen its [first public release](0862), which was followed by a few more minor versions. In november an all-new version **3.0.0** was [published](0880).

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1700385664/blog/seyqgwcnbnqk44r30lb6.png" "Comentario 3.0 Dashboard." "border shadow" >}}

### Ymuse

[Ymuse](/software/ymuse), a GTK frontend to the [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/), has become [available](0851) in the standard package repositories of Ubuntu **23.04** and Debian Testing. I also released the version [0.22 Xylophone](0878) with support for drag-n-drop and a brand-new icon.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1696435031/blog/kk4yvcrmub7dmqq25tc7.png" >}}

### Omgevingswet

Now this is truly professional. And it's not happened just yet, but it will in a moment. January **1**<sup>st</sup> {{< yearn 2024 "next year" >}} a new regulation called [Omgevingswet](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/omgevingswet) will come into effect. It will replace **26** other laws that regulate various aspects of the living environment ({{< fl "leefomgeving" >}}): construction, permissions, restrictions etc.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1703974451/blog/an3kunk2gnafwp2vrjlm.png" >}}

The website at [omgevingswet.overheid.nl](https://omgevingswet.overheid.nl/home) is the single entry point for the whole country, and I'm one of those who built it. According to the plan, at **00:00** on January first it'll expose all the new functionality provided in the new regulation ðŸ¤ž

## Cultural events

### Den Bosch carnival

Last February we took part in the traditional carnival in the Dutch city of Den Bosch (it gets renamed to {{< fl "Oeteldonk" >}} during the event). It's a lot of fun, even though it's pretty cold. My outfit turned out a bit too popular with the (tipsy) crowd.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704021268/blog/gesogtu7nl3blqwrdyci.jpg" "Oeteldonk carnival." >}}

### King's Day

April **27** is the King's Day in Holland. Lots of orange in the streets.

### Spoffin

August is a high time for festivals, concerts, and the Pride here. There was a new edition of {{< fl "Spoffin" >}}, a street arts festival, held in Amersfoort. Despite the rainy weather and the holiday period the streets were overcrowded.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/v1704022053/blog/si2jmrl8pl1qgwwaxbkf.jpg" "Spoffin 2023 in Amersfoort." >}}

Phew. As I re-read the above, it's been an eventful year.

**Happy New Year to all my readers!**

May **2024** prove a better, more peaceful year for all of us.
