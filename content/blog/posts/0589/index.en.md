This day marks the end of the **47**-year-long history of the Great Britain as a part of the European Union.

Even though it doesn't directly affect me, I find it a bit sad. I second [Boris Akunin's opinion](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1507974016019273&set=a.100672046749484&type=3) it's a regress and a victory of retrogressive thinking.

Anyway, that's now a reality, and I'm planning to drink some great European wine to itâ€”my favourite Rioja.
