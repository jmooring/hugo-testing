An amazing [news](https://github.com/yktoo/ymuse/issues/62) from Martin Dosch: [Ymuse](/software/ymuse) landed in the official [Ubuntu repositories](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ymuse)!

[Ymuse](/software/ymuse) is a GTK client application for the [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/) written in Go.

Previously it's become known that Ymuse [entered](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ymuse) Debian Unstable.

We expect [Ymuse](/software/ymuse) to appear in the upcoming **Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar Lobster** due in April {{< yearn 2023 "next year" >}}.

Huge thanks to Martin for his hard work on packaging and submitting the app!

And yeah, that makes me a kinda direct contributor to Debian and Ubuntu, isn't it cool huh?
