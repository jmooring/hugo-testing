My personal concert season open by the [Nightwish fellas](0264) is at its climax.

I was fortunate to see a very popular (yet kind of underground) band called {{< wiki "The_Aristocrats_(band)" "en" "The Aristocrats" >}} on December 9<sup>th</sup>. The band is playing some mindbogglingly complex tunes ranged from Jazz Fusion to Heavy Prog.

The Aristocrats is a {{< wiki "Supergroup_(music)" "en" "supergroup" >}} founded in 2011. Last December they were presenting their third studio album {{< wiki "Tres_Caballeros" "en" "Tres Caballeros" >}}.

Unfortunately I can't share much of it with you this time.

The problem is that {{< fl "De Boerderij" >}}, where I've seen [Neal Morse](0095) and [Arena](ru;0127), has got spoilt: I was disallowed to take my camera in! I find this outrageous, especially considering how many shows I've seen here in Holland.

I tried to use my mobile for filming as the next best thing, but at a certain moment was approached by a crew member, who told me that shooting videos was not allowed at all. (On a side note, people closer to the stage were filming whatever they wanted with their compact cameras, but that lad couldn't get to them through the crowd.)

On the bright side, I have to say the three play instruments like gods. The line-up is:

* {{< wiki "Guthrie_Govan" "en" "Guthrie Govan" >}} ({{< fl "Steven Wilson" >}}, {{< fl "Asia" >}}, {{< fl "GPS" >}}, {{< fl "The Young Punx" >}}, {{< fl "The Fellowship" >}}, {{< fl "Erotic Cakes" >}}) – **guitar**
* {{< wiki "Bryan_Beller" "en" "Bryan Beller" >}} ({{< fl "Steve Vai" >}}, {{< fl "Joe Satriani" >}}, {{< fl "James LaBrie" >}}, {{< fl "Dweezil Zappa" >}}, {{< fl "Dethklok" >}}, {{< fl "Mike Keneally" >}}) – **bass**
* {{< wiki "Marco_Minnemann" "en" "Marco Minnemann" >}} ({{< fl "Steven Wilson" >}}, {{< fl "Kreator" >}}, {{< fl "Joe Satriani" >}}, {{< fl "Paul Gilbert" >}}, {{< fl "Necrophagist" >}}) – **drums**

The lists of acts above should give you a hint of how brilliant they are. The brightest band member is arguably the British {{< wiki "Guthrie_Govan" "en" "Guthrie Govan" >}}, which is a true guitar virtuoso. You must hear that to really appreciate his playing.

Because of the new stupid rules I was only able to record a couple of videos of a questionable quality.

The first one was a story about an incident at a gas station somewhere in Texas, narrated by the bassist Bryan Beller and going over a minor car accident, a desperate female driver and a happy settlement:

The second one was the *Texas Crazypants* written after this event:

{{< youtube "EP7ZwqPw108" >}}

Listening to their numerous stories I was a bit surprised how trite were the stories that led to their super-intricate compositions. Most of them happened "somewhere in the States during a tour."

The club was packed. However I'll try to avoid {{< fl "Boerderij" >}} as much as possible from now on.
