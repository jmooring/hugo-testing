We have a new family member. Meet our {{< wiki "Bengal_cat" "en" "Bengal" >}} **Cheetah**.

We didn't give her the name. I reckon, the previous owner noted the resemblance to one.

Cheetah has just turned three. She's pretty calm for a Bengal. She loves sleeping on the windowsill, basking in the sun.

Or, conversely, in the darkness of the garage.

Having a composed character, Cheetah is nonetheless somewhat willful. Which is what a decent cat is supposed to be.

Cheetah has only been with us for two weeks, so she is still getting used to her new owners.
