On the subject of music and electronics at the same time: I wanted to share this video with you. It's a live recording of *The Way You Make Me Feel* (originally by Michael Jackson) by a girl who calls herself [Kawehi](https://www.facebook.com/iamkawehi). No instruments, just voice and a looper device:

Even though I am not moved at all by Mr. Jackson's music, I really liked this version of his song. The doggies' work is also worth mentioning for the pokerface they manage to keep for the entire performance.

It might be, of course, the take one hundred and eighty, but heyâ€”the final result is what counts.

On a side note, I have to say that looping techniques become popular in live shows. Petrucci used it in *A Life Left Behind* during the [The Astonishing](0272) tour. Also Daniel Cavanagh (*Anathema*) used it in *Thin Air*, as I noticed while watching their latest video, *A Sort of Homecoming*.
