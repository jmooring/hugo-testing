A little less than a year ago, on **22** May {{< yearp 2020 "last year" >}}, I [released](0748) the first public version of MPD client with the strange name [Ymuse](/software/ymuse).

These days we're at a **100** stars [on GitHub](https://github.com/yktoo/ymuse) and **270** active weekly users of the [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/ymuse) only!

Ymuse has got more than a hundred commits and dozens of new features in the past year. And there will be more: the priorities lie now with the upgrade to Go **1.16** and the latest [gotk3](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3) (which had lots of updates recently).
