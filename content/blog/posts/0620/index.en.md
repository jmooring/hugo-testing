It's Friday! As a follow-up to the topic of symphonic metal started by [Osture](0602) in the previous edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music), this time I'd like to tell you about once-existed German band **Beyond the Bridge**.

During its lifetime the band has recorded the only album, but it's a real masterpiece (you wouldn't see them in this series otherwise).

## The Old Man and the Spirit

**Beyond the Bridge** first appeared in **1999** as a school project in Frankfurt (Germany) titled *Fall Out*. After the graduation the friends went to different cities to continue their study. It wasn't until **2005** that the guitarist Peter Degenfeld-Schonburg has got the idea of a concept album, which he then developed for the next five years.

The only album released by the band, **The Old Man and the Spirit** (**2012**), is such a quality work that some even [call](https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Beyond_the_Bridge/The_Old_Man_and_the_Spirit/328370/Silicon_Messiah/368055) it *"possibly the greatest progressive metal album of all time"*.

The essence of the story is a dialogue of an old man (sung by *Herbie Langhans*), desperate to conceive the meaning of life, with a spirit (vocals by *Dilenya Mar*). The spirit, on the other hand, has the wisdom of the world but is seeking to understand real-life experiences. So she offers the old man a deal: the old man surrenders his memories but acquires the wisdom in return.

What's inside is intense progressive-symphonic sound, masterly played instruments and the vocals by *Dilenya Mar*, which gives me the shivers.

The recording had started in **2008** and, like with [Ostura](0602), the progress proved to be pretty slow. The album was only finalised in **2011** and released by *Frontiers Records* in January **2012**.

## Line-up

All project's members play their instruments at a professional level. They have scored various awards, mainly in the classical and jazz genres.
