Yesterday, December 17<sup>th</sup>, Houten hosted a charity event called [Rotary Santa Run](http://houten.rotarysantarun.nl/). For just **â‚¬10** every participant got a red Santa Claus outfit, a couple of drink vouchers, and a possibility to take part in a funny and useful event. The collected funds will go to the organisations {{< fl "Jeugdsportfonds Houten" >}} and {{< fl "De Nierstichting" >}}.

A total of about five hundred Santas of all ages and walks of life have gathered at the central square of our Houten.

The distance was pretty humble and feasible for anyone capable of running: **3.3 kilometres**. Here's a video of the start of the run:

While Santas are away, the crew is busy with unpacking the medals:

Some thirteen minutes later the fastest ones cross the finish line:

I didn't take part in this event (I usually prefer somewhat longer distances), but our family was represented by my eldest son. The atmosphere was merry and festive, especially kids liked it.
