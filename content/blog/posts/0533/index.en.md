Friday! This sixth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) features the model djent band [Vitalism](http://www.vitalismband.com/) from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

**Vitalism** was started in **2014** as a solo project of guitarist *Ed Garcia*, who recorded a single called *Gradus*.

In my opinion it's a damn good job, it reminds me of one of my favourites, *Intervals*.

## Music

*Vitalism* is mainly about *instrumental progressive metal*, but not limited to that.

The single was soon followed by the **Causa** EP (**2015**), which sounded pretty eclectic. It nicely combines harsh djent riffs and masterly tapping guitar solos with folk Latin American tunes and acoustic parts.

The last released album to date, **Sy** (**2017**), has broaden the scene even further with a good deal of programming that added acid notes to their sound.

A must-listen. I'm eagerly waiting for their next works.

## Line-up

* *Ed Garcia* — guitar
* *Lucas Moscardini* — guitar
* *André Casagrande* — bass
* *Marvin Tabosa* — drums
