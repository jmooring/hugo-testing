Being in the software business for a couple of decades, I used to think it's generally a good idea to test the software you develop *before* you ship it out. Yet, I keep stumbling upon situations where the developer doesn't seem to recognise the value of tested software.

Say, I've been using the **Foscam C1** webcam for a couple of years, one that looks like this:

I've bought back in the day it not only because it was reasonably priced, but mainly thanks to the fact you can play its video stream with any {{< fl "RTSP" >}}-capable player, for example, [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). All you need is to open the following address:

```
rtsp://<username>:<password>@<IP address>/videoMain
```

Unfortunately, you can't configure it to use a fixed IP address, but this can be worked around with *DHCP address reservation* on the router.

Its [mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foscam.foscam), which is needed if you want to watch the video feed outside of your home network, is as good as horrible. It seems to violate every single UX design patternâ€”which is not so uncommon with our Chinese friends I must say.

But hey, *this* stands out even for the Chinese software standards. Have a look how they've implemented the pattern login function in their app (which they call "gesture login" for some reason):

They've managed to spice up the boring pattern login process with a touch of an adventure and unpredictability!

My kudos, Foscam developers!
