Igor Abakumov, also known as Mr. Raskolnikov, an ex-member of [Radiolaria](/radiolaria), has shared some new material with me: tracks that were recorded for his own solo project called [Zapreschennaya Akustika](https://www.realmusic.ru/zapreszennayaakustika/) ("Forbidden Acoustics").  Even though it's a home recording and perhaps you can't really appreciate the Russian lyrics, the musical aspect seemed quite interesting to me.

So far four new tracks are available, all of them pertain to the sky for some reason:
