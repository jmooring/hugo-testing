Thank God it's Friday! Which means it's time for a next bit of my [Musicellaneous](/series/music) micro-discoveries!

Our hero today is the prog-djent duo **Victoria**.

## Line-up

Victoria is a cooperation of the djent veteran {{< wiki "Matt Garstka" >}}, the full-time drummer at *Animals as Leaders*, and the talented yet not-so-well-known guitarist *Joshua (Josh) De La Victoria*.

Victoria's music can perhaps be described as mechanical and melancholic. Personally it reminds me of [Mestís](/videoartists/mestís), a project of another Animals as Leaders' member Javier Reyes.

## Modern Value

In 2018 Victoria has released their debut EP called [Modern Value](https://matt-garstka.myshopify.com/products/modern-value-ep). It featured **7** tracks and *"28 minutes of exciting rhythms and vibey harmony in refined compositions."*

I'm not really into this type of melancholy and I'd normally prefer more "energy-loaded" compositions like those by [Arch Echo](0480). Nonetheless, it's pretty interesting musically and I do think Josh has a potential.

The musicians have recently recorded two new singles, *Kepler* and *Iris*:

I'll definitely keep watching their development.
