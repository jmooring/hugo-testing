I stumbled upon a [post on Reddit](https://yktoo.me/gw8ghN) showing a *drinking calendar* for {{< yearp 2023 "the last year" >}}, visualised by a **36** years-old guy. Frankly, it's quite a disturbing picture for someone familiar with health risks related to alcohol — which I learned about from a [podcast by Andrew Huberman](https://yktoo.me/nM448E). The author recorded **181** days with alcohol plus **5** (!) blackouts.

So I decided to make my own drinking calendar.

I've been keeping a daily diary for about seven years now, in which I also noted my alcohol consumption. Luckily my chart isn't nearly as colourful as in the [original posting](https://yktoo.me/gw8ghN). I hardly ever drink more than two drinks a day (a drink equals ca. **14 g** of ethanol, which is about a can of beer or **150 ml** of wine), and I never blacked out in my life.

There's clearly some room for improvement: my target consumption is one or two drinks per two weeks. The sober/drinking days ratio is currently just above **3:1**. I can't see any pattern otherwise, save for a slight increase during holidays.
