My abbreviation dictionary [afk.best](https://afk.best/en/) has received an option for searching abbreviations only (and not all available fields).

<!--more-->

For that you'll need to tick off the **In abbr. only** check box:

{{< imgfig "afk-best-en.gif" "Searching only abbreviations or all fields on afk.best." >}}

If the check box is cleared, all fields, including the translation, will be sought. Any punctuation or whitespace are ignored just like before.

You can also create links to specific abbreviations using either of the following patterns (replace `XXX` with the desired abbreviation):

* `https://afk.best/en/#XXX` (searching all fields)
* `https://afk.best/en/#XXX&abbr` (searching the abbreviation field only)
