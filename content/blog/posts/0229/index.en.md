While euro and dollar are *enjoying* a record growth in Russia, we're enjoying one of the warmest autumns on record here in Holland, yet [again](0118). Whatever caused it, sanctions or global warming.

On the 1<sup>st</sup> of November a weather station in {{< fl "Ell" >}}, which is at the very south of the country, has [registered](http://weerstatistieken.nl/ell/2014/november) the highest temperature ever, 22° C (72° F). Unbelievable.

It's a perfect weather to take a walk in nature. The {{< fl "Heidestein" >}} estate is just about a Buk's throw away from our place. Further on it merges into the Utrecht Hill Ridge (known for their [pyramids](ru;0157)).

A similar phenomenon was also on [November 2](http://www.nieuws.nl/algemeen/20141102/Warmste-2-november-ooit), as well as the rest of the autumn 2014.

The nature responds to the unprecedented warmth with a multitude of colours.

The last summer was also unusually warm and sunny. On June 19<sup>th</sup>, the day of our house*warming* party, the temperature hit [33° C (91° F) in the shade](http://weerstatistieken.nl/de-bilt/2014/juli). It's extremely hot for these latitudes, especially considering our typical humidity of 200% it felt like a sauna.

However it's back on track now and thermometer readings fall in a customary range of 12-15° C (54-59° F).

But the humidity is always there. Just as [before](0128).
