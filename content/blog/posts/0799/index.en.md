[Ymuse](/software/ymuse) version **0.18** is released.

Ymuse is a client application for the [Music Player Daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/).

## What's new

<!--more-->

When it comes to visible changes, there's only one in this version: the Preferences dialog has got a new tab called *Automation*. It allows you to configure actions to execute after the play queue has been replaced â€” for instance, after double-clicking a playlist in the Library:

* Switch to the Queue tab (enabled by default);
* Start playback.

There is also a couple of notable changes under the hood:

* The code is updated to use Go 1.17 and the latest `gotk3`/`gompd` versions; the minimum supported GTK version is now **3.22**.
* The project's build pipeline has migrated off Travis CI (because of their annoying policy changes) to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/yktoo/ymuse/actions). So far so good, the only downside I see is that building a snap package takes up to an hour now.
