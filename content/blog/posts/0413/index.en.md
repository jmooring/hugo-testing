It recently occurred to me that it would be convenient to have a dedicated section that lists the most common Dutch terms. Each term could then provide a brief explanation and references to relevant blog posts, and be linked to.

Thus there is the [Glossary](/glossary) section now.

<!--more-->

This section is currently in development so it's a bit scanty, but it will grow full over time.

On a side note I'd like to highlight the ease of making such functionality with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). All you need to do is create a couple of directories and write two tiny ([list](https://github.com/yktoo/yktoo.com/blob/master/layouts/glossary/list.html), [terms](https://github.com/yktoo/yktoo.com/blob/master/layouts/glossary/terms.html)) HTML templates—and voilà! Crosslinking, term lists, Markdown support, and other stuff you get for free so that you can focus on making content rather than formatting it.
