Is it also Friday where you are? In this thirteenth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) we continue to learn about lesser-known yet very *progressive* bands with a three-word title.

Today we're listening to [Lost in Thought](https://www.litband.co.uk/) from Swansea (Wales, UK) which plays melodic *progressive metal*.

## Music

The band's fate wasn't peachy (well, whose is?). It was founded in **2007**, released its debut album **Opus Arise** in **2011** and disbanded shortly after.

In **2016** the band's guitarist David Grey decided to reform **Lost in Thought** and managed to find new members for it. With the renewed line-up the band has recorded and released **Renascence** (**2018**)—a pretty symbolic name indeed.

Actually, this last album is the reason I'm writing about them. Their firstling *Opus Arise* was a good quality work but nonetheless a bit too mainstream. In contrast, *Renascence* shows a good deal of progress (and progressive), which must partly attribute to the new line-up.

I love literally everything about *Renascence*: the composition, the arrangement, the vocals, and the instruments. Here, please enjoy:
