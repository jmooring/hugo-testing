As I don't seem to ever have time to write a proper post about it, I'll share a video of our recent Christmas wintersport occasion.

We decided to go to the **Paradiski** region (where I've [been six years ago](0306)). The region is comprised of three large resorts: {{< fl "La Plagne" >}}, {{< fl "Les Arcs" >}}, and {{< fl "Peisey-Vallandry" >}}.

Back in **2017** we stayed in {{< fl "La Plagne" >}}, this time we booked a hotel in {{< fl "Peisey-Vallandry" >}}, but snowboarded mostly in {{< fl "Les Arcs" >}} (and one day in {{< fl "La Plagne" >}}).

Halfway into our vacation my wife decided to switch to skiing all of a sudden; she claimed it was easier ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
