All you need to do to get hold of an e-visa is fill out an application form on the [MFA website](https://evisa.kdmid.ru/en-US) not later than **4** days before entry, and attach your digital photo to it. No other documents are needed.

What I find the most surprising in this story is that this servce is **free of charge**.

## Limitations

According to the website of the ministry of foreign affairs:

> E-visa can be used for entering and leaving the Russian Federation at the following checkpoints:
>
> 1. Pulkovo international airport;
> 2. Naval checkpoints "Vysotsk", "Big port Saint Petersburg (Marine Station)", "Passenger port Saint Petersburg";
> 3. Automobile checkpoints "Ivangorod", "Torfjanovka", "Brusnitchnoe", "Svetogorsk";
> 4. Pedestrian checkpoint "Ivangorod".
>
> It is not possible to enter Saint Petersburg or the Leningrad region using railways.

**Important:** foreign nationals granted an e-visa are only allowed to travel **within the Leningrad region**.

## How it all works

A walk-through from the same website:

I think it's a great news, especially when you compare this procedure to the hassle of the [regular application process](0258) for a Russian visa.
