Hi all, I'm still there, alive and well.

Lately I've been busily developing my very own website in the wild world of Internet. Now that I'm mainly done I'm happy to present it to you: [yktoo.com](/).

The website is divided in three main sections: Blog, Software and Media.

Each of them has cost me quite an effort of writing, spell-checking and translating. Of course it's still full of typos and rough edges, which I'd be very grateful to come after via the [contact form](/about/contact).

This website puts together most of the things, previously scattered over a number of other websites, that were keeping me busy last years.
