Gee it's Friday again! The fifteenth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) continues to introduce you to *progressive* bands having a **4** in their name.

This time I'm going to pull the American instrumental-progressve-jazz band **4Front** out of my music treasure chest.

This project is as little known as it is fascinating. You will hardly find any information about it on the Internet, save for the band's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/4frontband/).

## Music

Just like [Ostura](0602) the band describes their music as "cinematic."

They mention *Rush*, *Dream Theater*, *Kansas*, *Porcupine Tree*, *Symphony X*, *The Dixie Dregs*, and *Genesis* as their influences, but to my taste they're the most close to our previous exhibit [7for4](0644), maybe with more melodic and bluesy lines.

Most of **4Front**'s tracks are composed by the guitarist Zak Rizvi.

Throughout its history the band has released three albums: **Gravity** (**1998**), **Radio Waves Goodbye** (**2002**), and, after a long break, **Malice in Wonderland** (**2012**).

The band's music is instrumental with the only exception of a cover on David Bowie's *Space Oddity*, a pretty nice one:
