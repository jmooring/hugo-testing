As it turns out, you can make postcards yourself.

Furthermore, they will feel much more special and, with a bit of luck, prettier than ones from the store!

Bigger pictures are under the cut.

What you'll need to create a masterpiece:

* Decoration paper (here it's called {{< fl "Design paperpad" >}} or {{< fl "Design pad" >}}).
* Paper glue.
* A handful of decoration material, like glass beads, buttons, little stickers etc.
* Glitter.
* A pinch of imagination: apply as needed.

Here's what we managed to cook up for the upcoming Christmas and the New Year:
