The website [afk.best](https://afk.best/en/), which I [launched](0381) two years ago, has got a facelift.

It's an **online dictionary** helping you decipher all those tricky Dutch abbreviations and acronyms you stumble upon so often that it can drive you mad.

The website [afk.best](https://afk.best/en/) has been recently updated (I've upgraded [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) from version **4** to **5** in case you're interested). I also keep adding new abbreviations I come across now and then.

If you think there's something missing there, please [let me know](/about/contact). Tech-savvy dudes can also make a pull request [here](https://github.com/yktoo/afk.best).
