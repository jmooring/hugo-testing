It's been exactly one year since I've had [laser eye surgery](0112). As aftercare I got a number of checkups: the next day, one month and three months later, and, finally, after a year.

The outcome is as follows: left eye **0**, right eye **-0.5**. The right eye was lagging behind before surgery as well, but with both eyes I have a 100% vision, so I'm feeling comfy and happy. Moreover the doctor told me my "minus" will gradually turn into "plus" (literally and figuratively) so I'll be less dependent on reading glasses.

Speaking of times before the treatment, all those glasses and contact lenses have been nothing but a nightmare.
