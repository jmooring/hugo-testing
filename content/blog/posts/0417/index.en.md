After a few months with [Hugo](0346) I believe I've worked out some practices one might find useful.

In this post I'd like to introduce a shortcode I'm using **a lot** in my posts: `imgfig`.

## What are shortcodes?

In short, a *shortcode* is a kind of template you can use in your content files. They can be trivial, like those wrapping a piece of text in a `<b>...</b>` sequence, or quite involved like the built-in `tweet` shortcode. You can learn more on that from the [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).
