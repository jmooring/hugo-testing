I've finally managed to move my blog from Blogger onto a self-developed platform.

The new address of the blog is: `yktoo.com/blog`.

The main reason for that is that Blogger neither supports, nor has any plans to support multilingual blogs. Furthermore, it's quite inconvenient to edit posts in HTML, whereas the WYSIWYG editor Blogger provides cannot properly handle images, not to mention more complicated stuff like tables.

Those who'd like to follow blog updates, can refer to the [Subscription](/blog/subscribe) page.
