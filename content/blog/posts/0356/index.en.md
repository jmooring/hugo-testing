Recently I've come across a couple of USB cables of Chinese origin (what else).

Cables that are a *real* innovation in my view. Carrying just regular **USB Type A** or **Micro USB** connectors, they can be plugged in both ways!

## Micro USB

Here's the Micro USB version. Notice the symmetrical shape of the connector:

So it's easily plugged in in both directions, here's the proof:

And it isn't charging-only, also the data lines are properly wired so that the data transfer is possible. You can buy one, for example, [on AliExpress](http://ali.pub/3oqjf5).

## USB Type A

This one has a Type C connector at one end, which is on itself symmetrical, but the cunning Chinese managed to make the conventional USB A plug at the opposite end also two-sided. It's really unbelievable:

And here it is in action:

I got this cable [also on AliExpress](http://ali.pub/3oqjre).

So one might wonder why aren't we using these just everywhere? That's a perfect solution to unravel the infamous USB superposition problem:

Why indeed.
