As soon as you turn into a [freelancer](0309) (also known as {{< fl "zzp'er" >}} in the Netherlands), you're free to choose the transportation method for commuting. Which I consider one of the benefits of being a freelancer.

So you can choose to walk, cycle, drive etc.—or to use public transport.

<!--more-->

And if your commute is long, the number of choices is in principle down to just two: car or train (plus, optionally, bus, train, or metro).

## Public transport

As for driving, it needs a separate post to explore its numerous aspects. For now I'll focus on using the public transit system ({{< fl "OV" >}}, {{< fl "openbaar vervoer" >}} in Dutch) in the Netherlands.

This system offers numerous benefits:

* It's cofmortable: it's *usially* clean, dry, quiet and air-conditioned;
* It's convenient: you're free to do whatever you like, including but not limited to sleep;
* It makes it easy to get to popular places;
* It allows you to avoid traffic jams;
* It's much cheaper than driving when travelling to a city centre;
* You may skip buying a car altogether, which is what many people living in Amsterdam do;
* It's the best option from the sustainability perspective. For instance, all {{< fl "NS" >}} trains are running on [green energy](https://www.ns.nl/en/about-ns/sustainability/energy/sustainable-energy.html).

At the same time public transport is also not entirely free from disadvantages:

* Getting to remote destination requiring multiple changeovers can take two or even three times as long compared to driving;
* It may be overcrowded during rush hours;
* Given a free parking spot, public transport is often more expensive, especially compared to car-pooling;
* It experiences disruptions from time to time.

In other words, the perfect choice dependens on your specific circumstances.

## Trains and the NS Business Card

When it comes to the public transport option, a freelancer is in a much more favourable position than a regular citizen.

That's beause {{< fl "NS" >}}, the Dutch Railway Company, is offering the so-called [NS Business Card](https://www.ns.nl/zakelijk/ns-business-card). All you need in order to get one is sign up for a business account ({{< fl "NS Zakelijk" >}}), which, in turn, requires a valid {{< fl "KvK-nummer" >}} assigned by the Chamber of Commerce.

### Benefits of NS Business Card

* You get a *Business Card* for free, whereas a regular {{< fl "OV-chipkaart" >}}, being in fact exactly the same type of a contactless card, will [cost](https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/ov-chip-kopen.htm) you **€ 7.50** every five years.
* It comes with no monthly charge by default, so you can order one and put it on the shelf until it's needed.
* It's post-paid, so you pay all your trips afterwards, once a month. Until recently it was impossible for regular {{< fl "OV" >}}-cards, but nowadays there's also a post-paid option available with [NS Flex](https://www.ns.nl/en/flex).
* Fixed-route subscriptions ({{< fl "Traject Vrij" >}}) are significantly cheaper their non-business counterparts.
* Subscriptions are cancellable on any day after the first month, which is also something regular travellers don't have.
* One card for all kinds of public transport: bus, tram, or metro.

*NS Business Card* owners get billed monthly and can return the VAT amount, like with other business costs. Furthermore, the costs are deducted from the taxable income and that makes it even cheaper.

### Available subscriptions

If you regularly travel with the train, it's likely you'll be better of buying one of the [provided subscriptions](https://www.ns.nl/businesscardaanvragen/) (all the prices are given for the cheaper **2** class trips):

{{< table "table table-striped" >}}
|Subscription              |Description                                                                                                                  |Monthly charge      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
|{{< fl "Dal" >}}          |**40%** discount on trips outside the rush hours on weekdays (09:00 until 16:00 and after 18:30), and all day in the weekend.|**€ 4**             |
|{{< fl "Traject Vrij " >}}|Free trips on a fixed route, it also includes all the benefits of {{< fl "Dal" >}} (more on that below).                     |Depends on the route|
|{{< fl "Trein Vrij" >}}   |Free train trips nationwide                                                                                                  |**€ 317**           |
|{{< fl "OV Vrij" >}}      |Free trips in all kinds of public transport (train, bus, tram, metro) nationwide.                                            |**€ 370**           |
{{< /table >}}

### The Traject Vrij subscription

Many people commute along the same route most of the time (home to office and back). Their best choice can be the {{< fl "Traject Vrij" >}} subscription, allowing for unlimited free trips between two stations of choice (you can also get on and off at any intermediate station on that route).

The only exception are long-distance routes where it might be cheaper to purchase the nationwide {{< fl "Trein Vrij" >}} subscription.

Here's a sample calculation for the route Houten—Amsterdam Central Station:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/cmfpu8zxom7r1384.png" "Houten—Amsterdam route subscription." >}}

As you see on the screenshot above, it costs **€ 221** per month. Exactly the same subscription for a private person will cost **€ 301**, which is quite a difference.

### Additional services

All *NS Business Card* owners can make use of the following additional services:

* Taxi
* Rental bikes ({{< fl "OV-fiets" >}})
* {{< fl "GreenWheels" >}} rental cars
* International trips with {{< fl "NS International" >}}
* {{< fl "Q-Park" >}} parking at the P+R ("Park and Ride") rate

These services are then included in the same monthly bill.

### Private trips

In my humble opinion, for private trips it's more convenient to have a separate {{< fl "OV" >}}-card from the accounting point of view.

On the other hand, you can classify your trips as business or private in your {{< fl "NS Zakelijk" >}} account, however it may complicate things, especially when it comes to VAT.
