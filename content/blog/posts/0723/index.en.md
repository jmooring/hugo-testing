Friday, so it seems (I have to admit four weeks into self-isolation you tend to lose track of days).

This twentieth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) presents the Australian guitarist virtuoso [Stephen Taranto](https://stephentaranto.bandcamp.com/) skillfully playing djent on *Abasi* signature guitars.

## Music

I already mentioned Stephen earlier as a member of [The Helix Nebula](0525), which impressed me both musically and technically back in the day.

In a sense, everything I said about The Helix Nebula also applies to Mr Taranto: the intricate rhythmical structure, the inherent melodicity with a pinch of ambient and the impressive guitar skills, it's all here.

He also shares his only problem with that band: the lack of available material.

Up to now he has only released a single EP called **Permanence** (**2019**), which—by the way—received great critical acclaim.

On the other hand, he's still quite young so I do hope more exciting music will follow.

I'd also like to recommend [Stephen's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/stephentarantomusic) where he publishes short guitar videos, pretty impressive.
