Friday is always imminent! For this eighth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) I had to dig a wee bit deeper this time. So I've dug out one of the most mysterious characters of the instrumental prog who is hiding behind the [Gru](https://grumusic.bandcamp.com/) monicker.

And I do hope it isn't related to {{< wiki "GRU" >}} whatsoever.

## Cosmogenesis

This Gru guy is intriguing indeed. There's next to nothing about him on the Internet. Actually, all I could find about him is that his real name is {{< fl "Piotrek Gruszka" >}} and that he's from Masovia, Poland.

Which makes it even more amazing, that someone with such a low profile, not participating in other projects (save for a few tracks by his friend [Widek](0673)) and not being enlisted with any label, is that talented. His mastering of guitar and sound programming are ming-blowing.

He managed to record and mix just one short album, which by the way turns ten this year, called **Cosmogenesis** (**2010**). The album has enjoyed great critical [reviews](https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/48991/Gru-Cosmogenesis/) back in the day.

Here, just have a listen (and keep in mind it's all done by one guy):

Even though the sound quality is perhaps not quite up to par with studio releases, I believe it's a phenomenal piece of homework.

## Any follow-up?

You can find a couple of other mentions of Gru on the net. For instance, [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOESYC5Fc90) by Widek.

Or this brilliant version of *Peacock* by Katy Perry, remixed by Piotrek:

People keep summoning *Gru* in comments, demanding more music. Yet, no reply so far.
