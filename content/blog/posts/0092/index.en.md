Yesterday's Easter has [set up](http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2499941/pasen-2011-vestigt-warmterecord.html) a temperature record in the Netherlands in the whole [KNMI](http://www.knmi.nl/) (Royal Meteorological Institute) observation history since 1901. Shadow temperature rose as high as [26° C](http://www.knmi.nl/climatology/daily_data/index.cgi?station=260&year=2011&month=04&day=24). The previous record was established in 1949 (24.5° C).

I got sunburnt in a couple of hours.
