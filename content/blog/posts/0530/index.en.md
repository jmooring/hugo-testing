The time flies by so fast, it's hard to believe so much has happened during the last year!

Looks like it's time for yet another [upshot](/tags/upshot) post?

I'll start with the most significant one: last July the most special woman [has become my wife](0345), which we then celebrated in Cannes in September.

During {{< year 2019 "this year" >}} I have also:

* Worked **1836** hours as a freelancer;
* Discovered and learned [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [reimplemented](0351) this blog and moved [to Cloudinary](0452) for media storage;
* Written **186** posts [in Russian](ru;/blog/archive), **59** [in English](/blog/archive) (this one included), and **9** [in Dutch](nl;/blog/archive), as well as **25** [Glossary](/glossary) terms;
* Run **813** km on **44** occasions (including one half marathon).

The rest will be described in the chronological order.
