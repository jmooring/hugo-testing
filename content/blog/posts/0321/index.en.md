It's been for the first time that a support act was as interesting for me as the headliners. At the end of the day, all three participants of *The Progressive Aspects Tour* proved to be up to par!

<!--more-->

It is pretty typical here in Holland to have an international line-up like this:

* [Oddland](http://www.oddlandband.com/) (Finland);
* [Until Rain](https://untilrain.bandcamp.com/) (Greek, but not entirely);
* [Wolverine](http://www.wolverine-overdose.com/) (Sweden).

I'm very fortunate to have a preference for as underground music as *progressive metal*. That saves me a lot of money, allowing to watch  three highly professional bands live for the ridiculous sum of **€18**.

I didn't take my camera with me, keeping in mind my past experience with [De Boerderij](http://cultuurpodiumboerderij.nl/) on [The Aristocrats](0267), when I had to hand it in at the entrance. The only gear I had was my [new GoPro Hero 5](0315#gopro-hero-5), which I slipped into my pocket. Which wasn't necessary as it turned out, as no one would care. Pity I didn't take a selfie-stick at least.

So please don't mind the quality of the photos taken with my mobile. The video quality, on the contrary, is quite decent. Many cameras have microphones with a very limited dynamic range, which causes a lot of sound clipping during rock concerts, but my GoPro handled it without a glitch. The only thing missing here is optical zoom.

Despite the low ticket price, the hall in {{< fl "De Boerderij" >}} was as good as empty. Perhaps it was caused by school holidays in Holland, during which many families leave the country.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/aacxaqpumr8w2672.jpg" "Before the show." >}}

The not-so-large {{< fl "CreativeColors Zaal" >}} hosted some thirty people of audience. A bunch of photographers, who didn't seem to be carried away by the music, would jump around with their shotgun-like cameras, trying to make their best shot. Which I found quite annoying (and no, I ain't jealous).

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/7xb2nadea1bs3093.jpg" "The audience." >}}

[One of the reviews](http://rockmuzine.nl/2017/05/02/progressive-aspects-tour-met-wolverine-rain-en-oddland-daalt-neer-de-boerderrij/) reports of two hundred spectators of this show, but you can see on the photo above that doesn't check out.

## Oddland {#oddland}

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/rlj6b9h1m5t62730.jpg" " Before Oddland's performance: seven string guitars of Sakari Ojanen." >}}

For me the almost-empty room was pretty flattering, but I felt a bit bad for the musicians. I remember from my own staging experience how disconcerting that might be. Even the sturdy [Oddland](http://www.oddlandband.com/) dudes seemed to be upset by that.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/vsrnh9rw3lwl2368.jpg" "Oddland." >}}

The band's frontman and singer {{< fl "Sakari Ojanen" >}} opened the show with a disclaimer that he wasn't in his best shape and that two days ago he couldn't even speak.

{{< youtube "XCcxJpLhtcE" >}}

But to his credit I must say I didn't catch any false note or a break-off. On the technical side the guys were brilliant. At the same time, it's quite common with progressive music that you need a while to let it sink in. As I never heard this band before, I had some hard time diving into the intricacies of their compositions.

Both guitarists, {{< fl "Sakari Ojanen" >}} and {{< fl "Jussi Poikonen" >}}, play seven-string guitars, which are usually used to expand the sound into the lows. Combined with the rich baritone of {{< fl "Sakari" >}} it gives the music some *doom*-ish tint, as you feel it resonate somewhere inside your stomach.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/zrlgr5ma2y8c2280.jpg" "Oddland: Jussi Poikonen and Sakari Ojanen." >}}

Their music sounded like heavier versions of {{< fl "Sieges Even" >}} (and {{< fl "Subsignal" >}}).

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/wtjsd22jjhod0022.jpg" "Oddland: Sakari Ojanen." >}}

Brawny and utterly serious {{< fl "Joni Palmroth" >}} played five-string bass, time to time contributing his growls to the sound.

Here's a moment when all three use tapping technique:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/qpwn1wt8nngo1465.jpg" "Oddland: tapping." >}}

My conclusion is that this band is well worth listening to, so it goes to my progressive piggy bank.

## Until Rain {#until-rain}

I've been listening to these guys for about a year now, and I was looking forward to seeing them live. The band only has three full-length albums to date, with the most recent *Inure* being out just a day before the show.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/vviunt2gje9g1226.jpg" "Until Rain." >}}

The live line-up of *Until Rain* is diverse:

* {{< fl "Konstantinos Margaritis" >}} a.k.a. {{< fl "Cons Marg" >}} — vocals (Greece).
* {{< fl "Theodore Amaxopoulos" >}} — guitars (Greece).
* {{< fl "Lef Germenlis" >}} — keyboards (Greece).
* {{< fl "Denis Efimenko" >}} — bass (Ukraine).
* {{< fl "Matthew Vella" >}} — drums (Malta).

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/ipvmkwrit6p43042.jpg" "Until Rain: Theodore Amaxopoulos, Cons Marg, Matthew Vella, Denis Efimenko." >}}

{{< fl "Until Rain" >}} are a cheerful and positive lot, which anyone can verify by watching their *Because Something Might Happen*, stuffed with horror and BDSM scenes, from the band's latest album:

{{< youtube "awpK4AoV3MU" >}}

I must also mention the vocals by *Cons Marg* possessing an incredible vocal range. I wish *Dream Theater* had a singer like him!

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/pf9as9uxrffe0393.jpg" "Until Rain: Cons Marg." >}}

I managed to talk to *Theodore Amaxopoulos* (30), a very friendly person, after the show. I expressed my regrets in connection with the poor attendance, which he reacted on by saying they had to play for 11 people once and that they didn't mind.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/09nmfx9lvp2n2534.jpg" "Until Rain: Theodore Amaxopoulos, Cons Marg." >}}

Anyway, I must admit the band's performance was amazing. Theodore also said he started playing guitar when he was fourteen years old, and that he also plays acoustic one.

*Denis Efimenko* (29) on the bass stands out because of the gloves he's wearing during playing. Although that didn't seem to negatively impact his play as far as I could tell.

Thanks to the low attendance it was easy to chat with the musicians after the show. And to make a traditional dark photo with the band:

## Wolverine {#wolverine}

The Swedish band [Wolverine](http://www.wolverine-overdose.com/) has been on my playlist for more than a decade now, and I consider them living classics, just like [Anathema](ru;0101#anathema) (whom they bear some resemblance to).

What's curious is that one gets some graphic image in his head as he listens to a band's music. And in my case, the real {{< fl "Wolverine" >}} had nothing in common with that image I had before.

I wouldn't probably recognise the singer {{< fl "Stefan Zell" >}} if I bumped into him on the street.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/phb347i2ec531920.jpg" "Wolverine: Stefan Zell." >}}

No long hair, no flashy outfits, the musicians looked much like typical office workers.

{{< fl "Per Henriksson" >}} on keyboard, notable for his bicepses, and {{< fl "Thomas Jansson" >}} on bass:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/hgh5ewueydj92580.jpg" "Wolverine: Per Henriksson and Thomas Jansson." >}}

The imperturbable {{< fl "Jonas Jonsson" >}} on guitar:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/ujcsmm97mzm73251.jpg" "Wolverine: Jonas Jonsson." >}}

(The drummer {{< fl "Marcus Losbjer" >}} is unfortunately nowhere on my photos.)

That said, I don't care at all how they look like, because their music is divine! I also tend to think they weren't delighted at the almost empty club.

Here's one of my favourite songs from the band's recent album {{< fl "Machina Viva" >}} called {{< fl "Nemesis" >}}:

{{< youtube "XhAjT1oJz8M" >}}

Stefan mentioned that Holland was his "second home", just like [Plini](0317) a month ago. Some people say {{< fl "Wolverine" >}} plays too many shows here, which I can't agree with.

Unfortunately the band didn't come out after the performance. Which is a pity as I'd really like to talk to them.
