Today, January 17, 2016, the nature has made an unexpected move. Last night a very thin layer of snow lay on the ground, for the first time in this winter.

This snow was more of a fad because it didn't last long in our temperature of **+5 째C** (41 째F), also because of the very bright sun in the morning.

There was already no sign of snow later in the afternoon.

This winter is yet again one of the warmest ever. For example, December 22<sup>nd</sup> was this year the [warmest on record](http://nieuws.weeronline.nl/22-december-2015-winter-begint-record-warm/) (**+13.4 째C**, 56.12 째F).

I actually don't mind that, I only like snow [in the mountains](ru;0239).
