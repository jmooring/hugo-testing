[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a very handy administration tool for the MySQL database server. Unfortunately, it has been [removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/bg0zvd/mysql_workbench_not_available_in_ubuntu_1904/) from mainline Ubuntu repositories as of Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo.

Luckily, it isn't that difficult to get it installed.
