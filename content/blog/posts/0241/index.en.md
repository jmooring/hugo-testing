A short announcement about a new subscription option.

If the term {{< fl "RSS" >}} seems completely foreign to you, there's now a Good Old E-mail [subscription](/blog/subscribe) option available for those who want to stay current with my blog. This way you will receive automatic updates by e-mail. Of course, you can unsubscribe at any time.

E-mail subscription links:

* **[English posts](https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=yktoo_en&loc=en_US)**
* **[Russian posts](https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=yktoo_ru&loc=en_US)**

This service is provided by [Google's FeedBurner](https://feedburner.google.com/) web feed engine; I'm in no way affiliated with it.
