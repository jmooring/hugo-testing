It's Friday people! The nineteenth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) features an Italian jazz rock fusion extravaganza called **D.F.A.**, which unfortunately ceased to exist a while ago.

By the way, the abbreviation stands for "Duty Free Area".

## Music

During its existence **D.F.A.** has released four studio albums and a live one.

Their debut {{< fl "Lavori in Corso" >}} (**1997**), whose name is translated as "Work in Progress", represented pretty original jazz rock with vocals in Italian and psychedelic notes.

The second one, **Duty Free Area** (**1998**), was enriched by a good deal of meditative and ambient moods. That's actually the one that triggered my attention to the band.

Here, have a listen to its opener, the brilliant *Escher*:

After that followed **Work in Progress — Live** (**2001**) and **Kaleidoscope**, which was a compilation of previously released tracks.

The last release in the band's history, named simply **4th** (**2008**), I deem the most developed and interesting, and the most *progressive*. I'd call its genre *prog jazz*, but I'm aware the term is normally used for something else.

I absolutely love the intricate, masterly tangled texture of **D.F.A.**'s music, ingeniously performed by the musicians, and the unobtrusive jazziness of their tracks.

Highly recommended.

To my great regret the band ceased to exist after a tragic car accident, which happened on **26** June **2011** and in which the keyboardist and composer {{< fl "Alberto Bonomi" >}} lost his life.
