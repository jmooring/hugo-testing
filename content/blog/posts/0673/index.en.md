A happy Friday the **13<sup>th</sup>** everyone! This sixteenth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) features yet another portion of fascinating space djent played by yet another one-man band, the Polish guitarist [Widek](https://widekmusic.bandcamp.com/).

Widek owns a [recording studio](https://widekstudio.com/), which he used to record and mix more than a hundred bands.

It's quite surprising how low-profile he is considering the number of musicians he played with.

## Music

Widek is pretty productive: since **2011** he has released seven albums and an EP.

His music reminds me of [Gru](0560), [Andromida](0588) and {{< fl "Sithu Aye" >}}, especially in its space/Universal theming, which is so popular amongst djent folks.

Many of his tracks feature guest musicians like the mentioned above *Gru* and *Sithu Aye*, but also [Owane](0492), *David Maxim Micic*, *Plini*, and others.

I can clearly see Widek progress over the years. However the fact his music is very repetitive shifts it a bit into the "relax and meditate" domain.

Well, his own defition of the genre is "ambidjent", which is fair and precise enough.

Anyway, I think it's perfect music for coronavirus-related home isolation, so sit back and enjoy!
