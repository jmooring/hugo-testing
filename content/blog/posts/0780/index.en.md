We're just back from the UAE. In Dubai all boards and announcements are bilingual, in Arabic and English. And it's worth noting English there is quite decent compared to other non-English countries.

Yet there is a blunder now and then.

Here's a board in a waterpark which discourages sharing Googles:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/kz7wlv4i0liccypeha9f.jpg" "Do not share Googles!" >}}

Which is obviously meant to be "goggles" but nonetheless funny. There's also an extra *should* further on.

Another funny typo: *braek time*:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/pe3sfkxfaoohvdgwhxmu.jpg" "Braek time!" >}}

This is no typo, but I personally doubt "creptastic" is a good name for a restaurant:
