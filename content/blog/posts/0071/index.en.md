Gary Moore would have performed at [Highlands Festival](http://www.highlandsfestival.nl/programma/) here in Amersfoort on May 27-28, 2011. People arranging the concert are now evidently upset.

It's always hard to conceive when people this famous leave us so unexpectedly. He was 58, didn't survive a heart attack.

My own solo guitar experience started just with "Still Got the Blues".

R. I. P.
