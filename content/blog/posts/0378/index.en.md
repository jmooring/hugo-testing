The Dutch will never stop to impress me with their ingenuity.

Being sustainable is now trending in Europe—and in Holland in particular. So in June {{< year 2019 "this year" >}} my client, {{< fl "NS" >}}, has [installed](https://www.ad.nl/utrecht/schommelend-je-telefoon-opladen-op-utrecht-cs-kan-het-en-misschien-zelfs-permanent~aa81fc36/) a special kind of swing at the {{< fl "Utrecht Centraal" >}} railway station.

This new attraction was presented during the "Sustainability Week" ({{< fl "Duurzame Week" >}}), and it can charge your mobile phone!

The three-swing installation was initially mounted on the ground floor of the station. It has been later moved to the first floor, where you can also find it today.

## How does it work?

Technically, the device is pretty straightforward. Anyone can inspect its internals through the glass cover.

The mechanical energy of swinging is spinning the generator's shaft:

The generator is charging a bulky **1 {{< abbr "F" "farad" >}}** capacitor, which looks very much like those used in the power chain of car subwoofers.

Further down the road you'll apparently find a **5-volt** power regulator, whose output is connected to {{< fl "USB Type C" >}} and {{< fl "Lightning" >}} plugs:

As soon as the user starts swinging, the phone charger box gets lit with green light:

## Nice idea, but…

The point is the charging is excruciatingly slow. After five minutes of eager swinging we didn't even manage to get the phone juiced up a single percent. Perhaps we needed to swing even more eagerly but that would turn it into a slightly different attraction.

Apart from its low energy output, I'm a bit confused by the thought you'll never find out what's on the other side of the charging cable. Can it be some obscure device that installs a backdoor on your mobile? Or, say, a [USB Killer](https://habr.com/ru/post/310442/)? The latter is really a piece of cake in such a setup.

By the way, there's a sticker inside the box saying *"Use it at your own risk"*.

Anyway, I believe it's a valid idea. We for one could harvest a few kilowatt-hours a day from our little daughter, we just need to find a way to turn her endless supply of energy into electricity.
