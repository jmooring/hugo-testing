Friday! This fourteenth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) presents a little known yet extremely professional German collective with the funky name [7for4](http://www.7for4.de/).

**7for4** was founded back in **1999** by the guitarist and the band's frontman {{< fl "Wolfgang Zenk" >}}. It has released *only* four albums to date.

But what albums!

## Music

The band's music, almost entirely instrumental, reveals combinations of genres as weird as its name. You can find anything ranging from jazz to funk to prog metal to blues and even country.

All tracks are composed by {{< fl "Wolfgang Zenk" >}}, a professional guitar player who played and composed for *Sieges Even* back in the day. He's also managing and teaching guitar at {{< fl "MGI Munich" >}}, one of the most renowned guitarist schools in Germany.

Their first album, **Contact** was released in **2001** and was immediately acclaimed by critics.

It was followed by **Time** (**2004**) and **Diffusion** (**2008**), and the last release to date, **Splash**, is more than five years old now (**2014**).

Strange enough, I can't even say the group has developed professionally. Their debut album sounds just as good as the most recent one.

All in all, it will definitely be a valuable addition to your music collection.
