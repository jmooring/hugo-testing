Yesterday, **28** December **2020**, about **21:00** Moscow time, you left us.

Another priceless life taken by COVID-19. We're still deeply shocked by how fast this tragedy unfolded. Less than a month ago you were perfectly sane and strong, albeit somewhat tired.

Then you were hospitalised into the Nikolayev hospital, whose hotline would repeatedly report a "good and steady progress" on you. Two weeks later you were dismissed from the hospital, but no one cared to explain to us you'd suffered **60%** lung damage and still had developing pneumonia.

After that you spent a few days at home, weakening and fading, almost speechless, until we realised something was terribly wrong. Then we rushed you to a private hospital, for there was no single spot available in any of the regular ones.

We were told you were in a very, very poor condition. They gave you at most ten days. You managed to live eight.

You were just four months short of your **85**. You passed away on the darkest day of the grimmest year. You went in peace and without pain. Perhaps, the best way to go.

You taught me everything I know. You were unparalleled in perseverance, meticulousness, and patience. You've been doing you morning exercises daily since you were **16**. You once told me you trained your endurance by forbearing to eat and drink.

You've always been on the move. You left Kherson for Siberia in the **1960**'s. Then, in the eighties, we moved to Tyumen. Then, on the break of the new millennium, to Belgorod. And, finally, to Peterhof four years ago.

You defended your Ph.D. thesis in **1980**, then the well-earned doctoral thesis in **1992**. I remember how proud you were of that achievement. You've written a few books, with the latest being the [course of physics](https://www.labirint.ru/books/697936/) published last year. A decade ago you asked me to make a [website on paradoxes of electromagnetic induction](http://electrodynamics.narod.ru/). To be honest, I can barely comprehend things it explains.

You never complained, even when everything would go haywire. You only regretted you didn't get great-grandchildren. You'd never say an unnecessary word or ask an unnecessary question. And we could always rely on you, without a doubt.

We're feeling sad and devastated at the moment. On the other hand, I think I'm lucky since *this* is the worst thing ever happened to me. Of course, it's inevitable. And the life carries on, only without you.

Farewell, my beloved dad, the stubbornness champion. Rest in peace.

Remember days of yesterday<br>
And how it flew so fast<br>
The two score and a year we had,<br>
I thought would always last<br>

The summer days and west coast dreams,<br>
I wished would never end<br>
A young boy and his father,<br>
Idol and best friend<br>

I'll always remember<br>
Those were the best of times<br>
A lifetime together<br>
I'll never forget<br>

Morning shows on the radio<br>
The case of the missing dog<br>
Lying on the fields at the only twelve<br>
Watching Harold and Maude<br>

Record shops, the stick-ball fields<br>
My home away from home<br>
When we weren't together<br>
The hours on the phone<br>

I'll always remember<br>
Those were the best of times<br>
I'll cherish them forever<br>
The best of times<br>

But then came the call<br>
Our lives changed forever more<br>
You can pray for a change<br>
But prepare for the end<br>

The fleeting winds of time<br>
Flying through each day<br>
All the things I should have done<br>
But time just slipped away<br>
Remember "seize the day"<br>
Life goes by in the blink of an eye<br>
There's so much left to say<br>

These were the best of times<br>
I'll miss these days<br>
Your spirit led my life each day<br>

Thank you for the inspiration<br>
Thank you for the smiles<br>
All the unconditional love<br>
That carried me for miles<br>
It carried me for miles<br>
But most of all thank you for my life<br>

These were the best of times<br>
I'll miss these days<br>
Your spirit led my life each day<br>
My heart is bleeding bad<br>
But I'll be okay<br>
Your spirit guides my life each day
