A surprisingly heavy snowfall has covered Holland with a pack of snow. Contrary to the [tradition](0268), the snow didn't immediately disappear but stayed for a few days running.

There's no {{< fl "wintersport" >}} this year because of the pandemic. But nothing is impossible for a creative mind!

You can always bend to circumstance and make it work in your favour:

The Dutch don't seem to care about cleaning inner roads from the snow. Or roads outside residential areas, for that matter, which get gritted with salt instead.

A few days later came the real fun: the canals got covered with ice for the first time since **2012**. {{< fl "Nederlanders" >}}, tired of staying inside, have turned that into a sort of fair, with music, {{< fl "glÃ¼wein" >}} and hot chocolate.

According to the weather forecast, we'll see positive temperatures as of tomorrow. The winter is apparently over.
