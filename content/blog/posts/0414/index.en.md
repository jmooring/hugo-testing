I'd like to start filling my [newborn Glossary](0413) with the term {{< fl "gemeente" >}}.

<!--more-->

{{< wiki "Nederlandse_gemeente" "nl" "Gemeente" >}} usually means one of the two things: a municipality or a local town hall.

## Municipality

A {{< fl "gemeente" >}} is the smallest administrative unit in the Netherlands. The cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam also had sub-units called {{< wiki "Deelgemeente_(Nederland)" "nl" "deelgemeente" >}} in the past, but in **2014** the number of administrative layers in the country has been reduced to only two.

Currently the Netherlands is divided into *provinces*, which, in turn, are subdivided into *municipalities*, a.k.a. {{< fl "gemeente" >}}s. As of 1 January {{< year 2019 "this year" >}} the European part of the country is {{< wiki "Lijst_van_Nederlandse_gemeenten" "nl" "made up" >}} by **355** municipalities.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/b7n42iqrlsfs0534.jpg" "All continental Dutch provinces and municipalities. Map by gemeentenatlas.nl." >}}

Next to these continental units there are also three Antilles territories, which bear a special status.

## Local council

There was a specific purpose for splitting up the country into {{< fl "gemeente" >}}s: each of them has a local government that defines rules applicable there.

Every {{< fl "gemeente" >}} has a mayor ({{< fl "burgemeester" >}}), a number of aldermen ({{< fl "wethouders" >}}) representing a local legislative body, and a council ({{< fl "gemeenteraad" >}}), whose members are elected by the inhabitants.

## Town hall

This is arguably the most common meaning of the word: town (city) hall, i.e. a place where the locals settle matters like marriage, birth registration, or construction permit.

The correct name for it is, however, {{< fl "gemeentehuis" >}}, {{< fl "stadhuis" >}}, or {{< fl "raadhuis" >}}. The word {{< fl "huis" >}} here means "house".
