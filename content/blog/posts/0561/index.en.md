Enough of those [router](0401) and [pump](0411) reviews! Today's review is the weirdest and the shortest one in this blog's history!

We'll unbox and study the *professional*, as the seller puts it, [nail clipper](http://ali.pub/4dpz10) by *Xiaomi*.

## Packaging

The sealed packaging contains a single piece of the professional nail clipper. The fact that it's sealed assures the hygienic state of the gadget.

## Nail clipper

Let's agree on this, the tool looks great. Kudos to Xiaomi designers!

Just look how pretty this one is:

The quality of the materials and the sharpness are great, too. The inside of the handle has a pretty rough nail file.

It's also worth mentioning the plastic cover that prevents the cut fragments from scattering all around:

The case can be taken off should you ever need to empty or wash it:
