[Martin Patz](https://github.com/patzm) has assembled and published a package for the [Sound Switcher Indicator](/software/sound-switcher-indicator) in the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/indicator-sound-switcher/).

It takes a single command now to install the indicator in **Arch Linux**.

<!--more-->

For example, if you use [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), you can install it like this:

```bash
yay -S indicator-sound-switcher
```

You can find more details in the [installation section](/software/sound-switcher-indicator/installation).
