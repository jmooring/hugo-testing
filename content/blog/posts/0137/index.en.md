Johannes Heesters, an entertainer born in Amersfoort, who [felt unwell](0132) just a few weeks ago, [died](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/entertainer-heesters-dies-at-age-108-after-long-career-started-in-nazi-germany/2011/12/24/gIQA8ITkFP_story.html) on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2012, aged 108.

I learned about that from EuroNews' broadcast, which even mentioned Amersfoort, and dubbed Heesters "Hitler's favourite singer". Whatever is true, R.I.P.
