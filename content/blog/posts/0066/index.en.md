From now on I'm going to make my blog bilingual. Unless I'm too lazy, or the subject is not intended for Western audience.

Fogs in Holland are more than frequent. One of such days I grabbed my camera and went out for photos:

The very late night (around 9 p.m.) drives everyone off the streets:

The town's central square:

A curious observation can be made at a longer exposure (like the one hereâ€”10 sec): spikes from diaphragm blades become clearly visible:

Streets are deserted:

Absolutely forsaken:

Even the downtown, which is overcrowded in the daytime:

The town's tallest tower seems to encourage one to commit a villainy:

Still, I ran across a few cranks with cameras, like me, in the deserted streets. Isn't it marvellous?
