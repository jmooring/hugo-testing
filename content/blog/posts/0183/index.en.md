I've [published](/videoevents/vevt0012) rare footage I filmed a few years ago. It was a performance given by two greatest jazz musicians of our time, [Daniel Kramer](http://www.kramerdaniel.com/) (piano) and [Arkady Shilkloper](http://www.shilkloper.com/) (French horn, flugelhorn, alphorn) at [Tyumen Concert Hall](http://www.tgf.ru/) on February 10, 2008.

The footage (consisting of 18 videos, including interim announcements) is filmed by me shortly before my departure to Holland. Up until now it's only been available via a [torrent](http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1555333) at rutracker.org. Daniel Kramer's videos are extremely scarce.

In my personal layman's opinion Kramer is by far the best contemporary jazz pianist. I don't know any other performer of equal expressiveness and technical proficiency. I attended his every concert in Tyumen, which is—sadly—not possible here. Never heard of him performing in Holland.

Shilkloper is admittedly a genius too. However I'm not really into the wind, so it's hard for me to judge.

Here's the first item from the concert, called Folk Song:

I couldn't figure out names of some pieces, so if you recognise any, I'd appreciate if you let me know them.

And to round off the subject: in the coming weekend the [yearly jazz festival](http://www.amersfoortjazz.nl/) will take place in Amersfoort again. A lot of live music is expected all around the city centre. Stay tuned.
