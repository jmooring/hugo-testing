I like {{< fl "Xiaomi" >}} gadgets and own quite a bunch of them.

I've been using their thermo-hygrometer [Xiaomi Mijia](http://ali.pub/3qdxv7) for about a year now. This neat gadget provides temperature and *relative* humidity readings.

## E-Ink display

You can find perhaps a zillion of similar thermometers, however what is special about this model is an {{< wiki "Electronic_paper" "en" "e-ink display" >}} (also called "electronic paper"). This type of display provides a *way* better contrast compared with conventional LCDs, but is also more expensive.

The thermo-hygrometer can be hung on a wall or put on a desk using the provided stand.

I bought mine [at AliExpress](http://ali.pub/3qdxv7) at a nifty price of **€ 9**, shipping included.

I've started with one piece to try it out, and it worked out fine. Then I bought another three. The e-ink display is gorgeous, especially in the dusk the difference with a regular LCD is striking.

## My experiences

This thermometer is made of high quality materials and well-built—just like any other {{< fl "Xiaomi" >}} gadget I own. It requires one **CR2032** battery located under the back cover. Apart from the thermometer and the stand, the package includes a piece of double-sided sticky tape and a sticky magnetic pad, which you can use to affix the gadget on the fridge, for instance.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/xsbaocevgeas3079.jpg" "The readings of all four thermometers are pretty closely aligned." >}}

As you can notice on the photo above, all four pieces I have provide very close temperature and humidity readings. The refresh rate is about once a half a minute.

Next to the temperature and the humidity numbers the e-ink display shows a weird emoticon, which is supposed to indicate the comfort level. As the temperature or the humidity goes up, the emoticon turns ~~even more weird~~ sad.

Under the back cover there's also a temperature unit switch (**°F/°C**) so one can choose between readings in Fahrenheit and in Celsius.

## Battery life

As I mentioned above, this devices uses one **CR2032** battery. When it runs out the display goes blank and a little crossed battery icon appears in the corner.

When it comes to the battery life, I have some mixed feelings. In some cases the gadget would stop working after just a couple of weeks, and sometimes it would last for eight to nine months—no clue why the difference. And a couple of times I've witnessed an even more peculiar behaviour: the display went blank and the battery-empty icon showed up but after a few hours I would see it working again ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Conclusions

### Pros

* Super high contrast display
* Decent quality build
* Lightweight and stylish
* Affordable price
* Can be used on a wall or standing

### Cons

* The battery lifetime is somewhat unpredictable
