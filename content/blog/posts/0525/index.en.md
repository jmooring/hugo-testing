It's Friday again, the time when music stars are falling from the sky, or now and then a whole nebula!

In this fifth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) I'd like to introduce the dear reader to [The Helix Nebula](https://thehelixnebula.bandcamp.com/), Australian wizards of *instrumental prog metal*, which sometimes diverges into *djent* and *math rock*.

## All the nebulae

**The Helix Nebula** is based in Sydney, Australia, and it's not to be confused with its namesake *Helix Nebula*. The latter comes from Spain and plays *death prog*. In fact, there's no similarity between the two bands whatsoever, except for the name.

Our today's heroes have the concrete and unambiguous **The** in the name, which, in this case, makes a lot of difference.

The Helix Nebula's line-up:

* *Jake Howsam Lowe* — guitar
* *Stephen Taranto* — guitar
* *Simon Grove* — bass and production
* *Nic Tresise* — drums

The band was founded in **2011** and I spot at least two well-known names in the above list: the bass player and music producer [Simon Grove](https://simongrove.com/), who played with numerous djent acts (*Plini*, *Intervals*, [Owane](0492) etc.), and [Jake Howsam Lowe](https://jakehowsamlowe.bandcamp.com/), the live guitarist of *Plini*.

## Meridian

Judging by the band's tour schedule it is still active, but mostly as a support act.

When it comes to their releases, though, there's just a single EP called **Meridian** (**2014**).

And I think it's a great pity, because *Meridian* is a real masterpiece in any aspect: musically, technically, compositionally, or in terms of the sound. It can be described as a fusion of classic djent by *Animals as Leaders* with the melodicity of *Plini*.

Highly recommended.
