A while ago I've made a decision to migrate off Disqus, which is arguably the most popular external commenting system for website owners.

## Why Commento?

The problem with Disqus, as with many other "free" products, was that you're most likely the product here. It has a ridiculously huge footprint (think *megabytes*) and "enriches" your page with more than a *hundred* additional HTTP requests.

Next to that, it shows adsâ€”which you can buy off at "only" $9/month with their Plus plan. How bad should it be to start to search for alternatives?
