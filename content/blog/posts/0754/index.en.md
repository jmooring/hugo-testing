A year ago my [Sound Switcher Indicator](/software/sound-switcher-indicator) has been [granted](0359) a free **All Products Pack** license from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=SoundSwitcherIndicator).

That license has recently been renewed and extended for another year, yay!

I believe *IntelliJ IDEA* is the most powerful IDE for nearly anything.

I'm actively using it for the development of [Ymuse](/software/ymuse) thanks to its excellent Go support, as well as for writing updates to this blogâ€”which doesn't contradict the license terms.

One of its killer features is the instant project-wide search with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>. Nowadays I can't imagine developing anything in its absence.

Thanks {{< fl "JetBrains" >}}!
