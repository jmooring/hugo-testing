And here we are, almost four months after the [exam](0273) I officially possess a Shodan Aikido Aikikai:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/skgvzt41286o1646.jpg" "Shodan certificate." >}}

The diploma has been solemnly granted by *Marc Jongsten* (who also took the exam) during a short ceremony at [Aikido Centrum Leiden](http://aikidoleiden.nl/).

Besides this—handwritten—certificate I was also given an official Hombu Dojo passport, instead of the former one, issued by the *DAF*:

This stuff is quite expensive I must say: {{< fl "shodan" >}} (first dan) costs **€ 125**, {{< fl "nidan" >}} (second dan) is **€ 175**.
