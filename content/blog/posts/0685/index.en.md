It's Friday! A pandemic is definitely no reason for missing out on the good music!

This seventeenth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) presents a mysterious and obscure band I bet you never heard of.

It's the jazz-funk-fusion project **Electric Outlet** from Germany.

## Music

Electric Outlet, like some other exhibits of Musicellaneous, has only released one album.

This album is called **On!** (**2006**) and comprised by nine tracks. Despite the fact they are so little known, all band's members are professional musicians who have participated in numerous jazz and fusion projects over the years.

The album's description on [Lion Music's website](http://www.lionmusic.com/artists/electricoutlet.html) states the music here was largely an improvisation. Yet it's so well played one might think they've been performing that for a decade or so.

Genre-wise I'd personally relate them to [4Front](0659) and [7for4](0644).
