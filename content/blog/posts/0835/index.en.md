The version **2.3.9** of the [Sound Switcher Indicator](/software/sound-switcher-indicator) is released.

<!--more-->

## What's new

* The Preferences dialog received a new **Prune configurationâ€¦** button, which allows to clean up stale device entries from the configuration file ([#120](https://github.com/yktoo/indicator-sound-switcher/issues/120)).

This can help revert settings to defaults, as well as clean up any unwanted or obsolete configuration.
