I've found recent [aerial footage](https://yktoo.me/qTqAIq) of Houten, the town we're [living](/series/houten) in, shot in **4K** with a DJI Mini 3 Pro.

It's a quality little film showing the main highlights and characteristic places in Houten.

The [Drone Chiefs](https://yktoo.me/VzyoDW) YouTube channel has a bunch of other drone videos of Dutch towns. For example, [Amersfoort](https://yktoo.me/o7tBoh):
