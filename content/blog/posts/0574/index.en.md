It's Friday! This ninth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) presents romantic djent played by the American band [Sea in the Sky](https://seainthesky.bandcamp.com/).

## Music

The first two albums of the band, their self-titled EP (**2013**) and **Serenity** (**2014**), were instrumental, featuring dense guitars and heavy djent riffs.

As for the latter two releases, **Visions** (**2015**) and **Everything All at Once** (**2017**), I'd say they diverge a bit from the regular repertoire of this series.

They've added vocals (like in solo works by [Yvette Young](0542)) whereas the sound has become somewhat softer and more romantic than in the earlier works of the band: it's half *djent*, half *prog metal*.

Unlike most other dject projects, *Sea in the Sky*'s vocals are clean, with no growling, and in my humble opinion they nicely complement the music.

Because of the vocals, the music reminds me of *Disperse*. However, Sea in the Sky's songs are characterised by more structured rhythmic and melodic lines.

## Line-up

The band was formed in **2012** in Redwood City, San Francisco, California.
