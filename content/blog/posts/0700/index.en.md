Friday again! I think I've hit the rock bottom in my quest for musical exotics.

This eighteenth edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) features a totally unknown to general public endeavour of Japanese jazz musicians titled **Presto**.

There's as little as nothing on it on the Internet. And if there were, you wouldn't be able to find it given the band's name.

## Music

As far as I could conclude, the only recorded, self-titled, album by the band (**2003**) has never been released by any label. Nonetheless, it's absolutely stunning.

The album is instrumental except for a couple of tracks. Its music is quite diverse, ranging from a ballad to progressive and jazz rock.

Since I couldn't find Presto's music anywhere, including YouTube and Spotify, I've decided to upload it to YouTube myself.

Here it is, enjoy:
