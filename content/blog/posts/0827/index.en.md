A new bugfix release **2.3.8** of the [Sound Switcher Indicator](/software/sound-switcher-indicator) is out.

## What's new

This version fixes two serious issues in the indicator.

<!--more-->

* The app could handle stream switching incorrectly in a case the sound card had multiple *sources* or *sinks* (as PulseAudio calls them). In certain cases that would even render the switcher completely dysfunctional ([#107](https://github.com/yktoo/indicator-sound-switcher/issues/107)).
* Pressing a shortcut bound to a port on an offline device would cause the indicator to try to switch to that non-existent device ([#118](https://github.com/yktoo/indicator-sound-switcher/issues/118)).

Resolving the above, particularly the first issue, took me hours of digging into the code and experimenting with PulseAudio profiles. From which I can conclude PulseAudio's profile support is far from flawless yet. Sometimes switching profiles a few times causes the sound server to totally break down, which you can only mend by restarting it (`pulseaudio -k`).

## Andâ€¦

And, last but not least, we have **300** stars [on GitHub](https://github.com/yktoo/indicator-sound-switcher) and **2100**+ snap package users!

## Ubuntu support in the PPA

My [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~yktooo/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) provides packages for Ubuntu **18.04 Bionic Beaver**, **20.04 Focal Fossa**, **21.04 Hirsute Hippo**, **21.10 Impish Indri**, and **22.04 Jammy Jellyfish**. Bug reports are welcome at the [usual address](https://github.com/yktoo/indicator-sound-switcher/issues/).
