My first visit to the see in this year is as early as the spring itself.

That's tempting, despite the fact that temperature is just above 10Â° C (and I don't want to know what water temperature now is). The sun is shining, and the spring is peeping out the road bricks:

It's vaguely visible on the horizon:

It's falling down to the sand:

In other words,

But the crowd is only interested in eating and drinking. Restaurants at the coast are full of lazybones:

Who's not afraid of cold water are horses:

and, traditionally, Dutch kids (who are remarkably frost-resistant):

Since I'm none of the above, I headed for a walk around the city.

## The Hague {#the-hague}

The Hague is not only famous for its beaches, but also for nice international courts and tribunals. Also the government resides here, and not in the capital.

They have a circus theatre with Mary Poppins:

Old houses of non-Dutch origin:

Loads of ancient cars:

A monument to the tax legislation:

A monument to a man strayed in a doorway:

The Hague is a special city, you can feel its history in its streets. It's full of antique buildings, museums and foreign embassies. I'll definitely visit it again.
