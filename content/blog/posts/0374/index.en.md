Today I've experienced a real paradigm shift. As I've found out, cubes are not the only shape you find sugar formed into (which has been my conviction for more then four decades to now). There also exist sugar cylinders!

I found these at a Lidl supermarket in the French Cannes.

The life will never be the same again.

And there's also another thing on the subject of curvy.

In my post I'd like to highlight the greediness of {{< fl "Nestlé" >}}. Just recently it looked as if we've finally found peace with these weird tiny conic coffee cups—which didn't even have a proper name, everyone would call them simply *Nespresso*. And you could finally find them in any supermarket.

 They thought, well, it's just getting too easy for our loyal customers, let's make it a bit more engaging. So they've introduced cups of a different shape—totally not compatible with the existing system—and called it *Vertuo*.

They're almost twice as expensive: starting at **60** eurocents a piece vs. 35-40 eurocents for the previous generation. Furthermore, to really challenge the customers' commitment to *Nespresso*, these cups can *again* be only purchased at Nespresso brand stores or ordered via Internet.

To lure you in they've priced the coffee machine as low as **€ 79**. Which is fine for them I guess, as you're going to spend way more on the cups afterwards.
