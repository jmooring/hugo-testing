Following up on the subject of [confusing language](0396).

What would you first think if you see a package titled {{< fl "Worst trio" >}} in a grocery store?

You will perhaps link the title to the picture of three complacent chefs right above it, apparently worst of their sort.

Well, to your disappointment it's actually translated from Dutch as "Sausage trio". Because that's what it is, three sorts of sausages in a single packaging.

And I wonder if the title has been chosen deliberatelyâ€¦
