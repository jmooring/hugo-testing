It's Friday! This twenty-second edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) presents a progressive metal opera by [Zierler](http://www.zierler.net/), a project by the Dane {{< fl "Finn Zierler" >}}.

Like {{< fl "Dan SwanÃ¶" >}}, who I [mentioned](0733) before, Zierler is rightfully seen as one of the prog scene patriarchs. He is mostly known as a founder and a keyboardist in the Danish band **Beyond Twilight**, which he started at the age of **20** back in **1992**.

*Beyond Twilight* was disbanded in **2008** and four years later Finn Zierler founded his solo project, which is much lesser known. So let's talk about it.

## Music

For this new project Zierler invited two singers: {{< fl "Kelly Sundown Carpenter" >}} from his former band and the Norwegian {{< fl "Truls Haugen" >}} from {{< fl "Circus Maximus" >}} (curiously enough, he doesn't sing there). Sundown Carpenter is also known for his vocals in *Adagio*, which **Zierler** reminds a lot, both by its music and its vocals.

So far **Zierler** managed to only release a single album called **Esc** (**2005**). Yet this only work proved to be epic: it's a full-blown progressive metal opera.

When listening to the album you immediately notice the intricate arrangements and the complicated rhythmical and melodical structure of the music, as well as the technical proficiency of the musicians.

Here's, for instance, {{< fl "Bobby Jarzombek" >}} drumming in *Aggrezzor*:

And this is a solo spot by {{< fl "Per Nilsson" >}} in the same track:

All in all, the band's debut is fascinating and many-faceted. Apart from the above-mentioned *Adagio*, it also reminds me of such progressive legends as *Ayreon* and *Symphony X*.

The only thing I didn't really appreciate in *Esc* was lots of growling vocals. But okay, that's the way the authors saw it.

## Line-up

* {{< fl "Finn Zierler" >}} - keyboards
* {{< fl "Truls Haugen" >}} - vocals
* {{< fl "Kelly Sundown Carpenter" >}} - vocals
