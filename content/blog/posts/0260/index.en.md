A year ago I [posted](0223) about fruit groves in Houten. Last summer brought a sudden news on that topic.

A decade ago our neighbour has planted a kiwi tree. The plant has been growing into our two gardens, but has never given a single kiwi fruit. Until the last summer, that is, because mid-August we've spotted the first fruit ever! Too bad for our neighbours, it was a dodgy one, as it's growing on our side of the fence.

Being pretty small, egg-sized, it's just a beginning. Give it a couple of years, and we'll be making kiwi jam!
