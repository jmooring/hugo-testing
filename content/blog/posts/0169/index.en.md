Finally I got to create a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/yktoo/yktools) for all my public domain utility tools (I had to fiddle quite a while with `git filter-branch` to extract all the 'safe for public' stuff from my home repo).

At the moment the following four scripts are available:

<!--more-->

* `generate-wallpaper-xml`\
    [Creates an XML](0168) wallpaper file with a slide show.

* `picasa-upload`\
    [Advanced picture uploader](0110) for Google Picasa, capable of watermarking images.

* `rotate-wallpaper`\
    [A simple script](0122) that sets a random image as current wallpaper.

* `update-exif-date`\
    Updates EXIF date in JPEG images according to the file name.
