Friday! This twenty-first edition of [Musicellaneous](/series/music) presents a project called **Odyssey**. It was started a decade ago by one of my favourite prog musicians, the Swedish multi-instrumentalist {{< wiki "Dan Swanö" >}}.

But we'll talk about Dan some other time. This series is meant to introduce you to lesser-known music, which **Odyssey** is a perfect example of.

## Music

**Odyssey** is yet another one of Swanö's myriads of projects. All instruments here have been played by him alone: guitar, bass, keyboards, and drums. And the vocals are all his, too.

Under this name the project has released the only album **Reinventing the Past** (**2010**). Most of its tracks are prog metal covers of various bands. Some of them make me feel pretty nostalgic.

This is, for example, a cover version of *Shake the Disease* by *Depeche Mode*. And I must say, it's even better than the original:

Here's another hit from the times of my childhood: *In the Heat of the Night* by *Sandra*:

In my humble opinion, it's just brilliant (which is the case with most works by Swanö).
