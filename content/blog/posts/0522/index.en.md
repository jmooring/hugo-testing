I like Xiaomi gadgets a lot and I've [reviewed](/tags/Xiaomi) quite a few of them.

I've bought a set of precision screwdrivers [Xiaomi Wiha screwdriver kit](http://ali.pub/4aa6sd) a while ago so now I can share my experience.

## Packaging

The packaging is a typical for Xiaomi white cardboard box, in this case proudly labelled with "Red Dot Award 2017 winner".

The only thing inside the box is an aluminium storage case of a rounded shape.

The paper lint crossing it warns the user that the screwdriver is not to be used for live circuits or be given to children and that the maximal torque of **2 N·m** must not be exceeded. It also encourages the user to "enjoy work."

In order to open the case you need to press on its top side, and the plastic bit holder will pop out.

## What's in the box

After that you can simply pull out the bit holder from the case. Here's the complete kit: a metal handle and **24** screwdriver bits:

Each bit is engraved with its type and size and the label "Wiha". They all are kept in place with a magnet, which is highly convenient: if you just put a bit there it will automatically jump into place.

The handle also has a magnet in the nozzle for holding the bit, but that's pretty standard.

## Xiaomi Wiha in action

The handle is three-edged and it's equipped with a rotating cap at the opposite end.

This three-edged shape provides quite a good grip, and the variety of the bits is wide enough for most purposes, like mobile phone (dis)assembly.

The bits are made of high-quality hardened steel, which distinguishes it from its cheaper analogues.

## Conclusions

### Cons

* The screwdriver is not electrically insulated, hence not suitable for live circuits.

### Pros

* Great design and quality.
* Sturdy and handy aluminum storage case.
* Click-open storage system.
* Magnets in the holder make taking out and placing bits back really easy.

## Where to buy

The **Xiaomi Wiha screwdriver kit** can be bought [on AliExpress](http://ali.pub/4aa6sd) for about **€ 16**.
