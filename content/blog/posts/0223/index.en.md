In the [previous part](0222) I mentioned the "Bike Town" award given to Houten a few years ago. This tiny geographical object has also won a number of other awards:

<!--more-->

* The [fourth place](http://www.dichtbij.nl/lekstroom/regionaal-nieuws/artikel/3415489/houten-beste-gemeente-om-te-wonen.aspx) in the "Top Municipalities 2014" rating by the newspaper [De Telegraaf](http://www.telegraaf.nl/). 431 Dutch municipalities were assessed based on house prices, crime rate, wages and social infrastructure (shops, educational and healthcare institutions etc.).
* "Model Municipality" in the [Canon van de ruimtelijke ordening](http://www.canonro.nl) ([PDF document](http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/bestanden/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2013/10/28/35-iconen-van-ruimtelijke-ordening-in-nederland/ro-35-icons.pdf)) catalogue. This document provides the most impressive examples of town planning in Holland between 1940 and 2015.
* "Street Litter Fighter 2012" ([ZwerfAfvalPakker van het jaar](https://www.houten.nl/nieuws/bekijk/archief/2012/maart/artikel/gemeente-houten-winnaar-zwerfafvalpakker-2012/)).
* "Best Municipality for Kids 2009" ([Leukste gemeente voor kinderen](https://www.houten.nl/nieuws/bekijk/archief/2009/mei/artikel/houten-leukste-gemeente-voor-kinderen/)) in the "Children in Numbers" ([Kinderen in Tel](http://www.kinderenintel.nl/)) rating. The ranking created by [Verwey-Jonker Instituut](http://www.verwey-jonker.nl/) was based on infant mortality, number of teenage mothers, youth unemployment and so on.

In other words, there's something to be proud of for {{< fl "Houtenaars" >}}. Let's see what distinguishes Houten from other Dutch cities.

## Old Houten {#old}

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/4uec51254v070170.jpg" >}}

Even though our house is in the new part of the town, I really like the old, green, half.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/dyuy0rw4u5m72903.jpg" >}}

The old town is crossed by a canal, which has about fifty bridges over it.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/zkiux0zmpq872051.jpg" >}}

It gets especially picturesque in the sunny weather.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/kujjn8op8ym92594.jpg" >}}

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/myq8ier00dfv1380.jpg" >}}

A bench in the shape of the word "HERE" ({{< fl "HIER" >}}) is apparently only used by birds:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/v619j1i3zgae0498.jpg" >}}

There are plently of them, just like anywhere in Holland:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/3g7jdz6vjtzl0734.jpg" >}}

But we, Siberian folk, get most delighted about public fruit trees.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/9ur232zth16h1431.jpg" >}}

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/hx1aff7kuyqg0730.jpg" >}}

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/lz1omzzglqv70945.jpg" >}}

The apples on them are as big as *real* French ones you find in the shop:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/zft65v8japun3483.jpg" >}}

And so are pears:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/js9b9jr7hp4g3307.jpg" >}}

Besides these, there's a lot of apples, pears, grapes, plums, cherries and even kiwis in private gardens. Some owners offer them for sale:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/v7y4c0efoan80692.jpg" >}}

It's a self-service counter, the buyer should leave the money in the rusty box down below.

However, the {{< fl "gratis" >}} fruits are just as good, which we've experimentally proven:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/nemjeh0jkdor2219.jpg" >}}

The pie is made of apples picked in a nearby grove.

A humble town-hall building is also in the old part. It has a clock-tower with a bunch of bells:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/n9u91xmuqwzc0223.jpg" >}}

A fountain, which is… uhm… a symbol of a mandatory fountain before the town-hall building:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/g361cy0gm2vp1816.jpg" >}}

Modern technologies in the old town: the Dutch love to invest in *sustainable*, hence the solar panels. Not only is it subsidised by the government, but also reduces your electricity bill:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/ql4r3yu58mcm3440.jpg" >}}

The oldest spot in the town, {{< fl "Oude Dorp" >}} ("Old Village"), is a tiny square that looks completely authentic:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/q7prcjyfsvk11159.jpg" >}}

Apart from restaurants and shops, there's a traditional belfry next to it:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/1u4ayes3gu1b2432.jpg" >}}

And a church:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/w9btkbjwhy2r2755.jpg" >}}

You can find the same setting in any Dutch settlement.

## Young Houten {#young}

Architecture of the new part is sometimes different, but you can always tell the new buildings by the exterior walls:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/cuu3jcvgaxq11929.jpg" >}}

I'm particularly fond of those yellowish bricks, which resemble houses in [southern Belgium](ru;0035):

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/kxufg5vgh53w2288.jpg" >}}

One of the eye-catchers of the new part is the three-wing pyramid called {{< fl "Het Domein" >}} ("The Domain"), the "hill-house" ({{< fl "heuvelgebouw" >}}) built in 2002 based on the design of {{< wiki "Robbert_en_Rudolf_Das" "nl" "Das brothers" >}}:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/pcn0gi4lc4nu1419.jpg" >}}

Each apartment has a terrace, all of them together forming the pyramid:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/rt51z20ql2gu0629.jpg" >}}

Most of the apartments located right above the water:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/vis2d16in66b2816.jpg" >}}

The nearby city beach on the {{< fl "Rietplas" >}} pool is not overly crowded in August. The little island on the left is only accessible via a shallow wade (which is about two feet deep):

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/621bg9x7deqs2822.jpg" >}}

These kids are fortunate enough to possess a {{< fl "fluisterboot" >}} (electric boat):

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/d7h61ynncglv2812.jpg" >}}

The pool is surrounded by houses, which must be pretty damp inside I think:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/8jbxndvqghju0670.jpg" >}}

This block of toy-like houses is built right above the water surface:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/matwwdq66t1q3566.jpg" >}}

In the medieval times the border of the Roman Empire lay here. This is reflected, for example, in the name of the {{< fl "Houten Castellum" >}} [train station](0221). All the streets in this neighbourhood have Italian names:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/n4zy3sas3gzw0313.jpg" >}}

{{< fl "Piazza" >}} means "square" in Italian.

These new houses are splendid in my opinion:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/6od84fxh3hxu2423.jpg" >}}

And, of course, a good deal of them are erected on water:

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/r1nyjlpj341r2375.jpg" >}}

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/df9p0cezkt3u1010.jpg" >}}

That's about all I have to say about my current residence. In my next posts I'll tell you more about *house-hunt*.
