The source code for **yktoo.com 3.0** is stable enough to be open for general public, which is something I was going to do from the beginning.

Today the code has been made available [on GitHub](https://github.com/yktoo/yktoo.com) and can be viewed, built, forked, [bug-reported](https://github.com/yktoo/yktoo.com/issues) upon etc.

So if you're curious how this all comes to existenceâ€”grab your chance!

## All you need is Hugo

Believe it or not, but building the website is utterly simple. You only need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). Then just run `hugo` at the project root:

Or, you can use `hugo server` to bring up a local web server with a fully functional local copy of the site.

Enjoy the weekend!
