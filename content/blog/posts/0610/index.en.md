It was my very first visit to the Dutch city of {{< wiki "Nijmegen" >}}, which is located near the German border.

The reason for my going there was a joint **aikido** seminar led by three senseis:

* {{< fl "Tom Dijkman" >}} (**6<sup>th</sup>** dan aikido aikikai);
* {{< fl "Jan Thesing" >}} (**5<sup>th</sup>** dan);
* {{< fl "René Habraken" >}} (**5<sup>th</sup>** dan).

So I was brave enough to not get scared off by storm Ciara (but nonetheless happy to be back home before dark).

## Three senseis

The seminar was three hours long, each of the teachers had an hour.

All three are very experienced, but all three differ in build and in style. I was fascinated to watch those differences during their performances of various techniques.

**René Habraken** is only **38**, which is very young for a fifth dan. He's quick and moves amazingly lightly. When I first saw him doing *jō* (wooden staff) techniques I was totally impressed. He is teaching aikido at the [Aikido Centrum Nijmegen](http://aikidocentrumnijmegen.nl/).

**Jan Thesing** is skilled, sturdy, powerful. This was the first time I met him. He teaches aikido at {{< fl "Budo Club Krommenie" >}}.

**Tom Dijkman** is one of the founders of [Aikido Amsterdam](https://www.tomdijkman.nl/), sporting an "academic" approach to techniques' details. I've been training with him since my [second dan](0360), preparing for the third.

## SportQube Nijmegen

The seminar was held at the {{< fl "SportQube" >}} sport center, very modern and comfortable. The attendance was some fifty people, I think.
