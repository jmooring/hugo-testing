Happy first summer day to everyone!

It's been exactly two months since our world's best URL shortener [once.to](https://once.to/once) has entered [public beta](0772).

Dear, we've been busy! These two months resulted in a whole bunch of cool features.

## Smart link and the Link editor

I'll start off with the most exciting one.

Yesterday we [launched](https://docs.once.to/en/blog/0007/) a truly unique function: the smart links and the corresponding Rule editor. Using the latter you can make any link change its destination address according to the visitor's language, country, operating system and so on.

{{< imgfig "https://res.cloudinary.com/yktoo/image/upload/blog/dnje6ta72j4uylznevci.png" "Example smart link in the Rule editor." "shadow" >}}

Moreover, you can also add randomness to any rule by assigning it a certain *probability*. Using that it's very easy to set up {{< wiki "A/B testing" >}} for a landing page.

To learn more about smart links please refer to the corresponding [documentation page](https://docs.once.to/en/kb/smart-link/).

## Password-protected links

The second most important enhancement is more mainstream but nonetheless useful: [password-protected links](https://docs.once.to/en/kb/password-protected-link/).

You can specify a password for any short link. The visitor will later need to provide that in order to get redirected to the target URL.

The Password Required page supports language autodetection; you can test that by following this link: [1e.to/password-protected](https://1e.to/password-protected) (use `secret` for password).

## Performance improvements

Our [world's fastest](https://once.to/fast) URL shortener has just become even snappier. We've overhauled visitor statistics gathering, **once.to** can now easily cope with hundreds (and scale to tens of thousands) of visits per second. We're future-proof!

## Ignoring bots in statistics

Link properties have received an extra option for ignoring bots and crawlers when counting click stats.

This option is enabled by default.

## Small screen improvements

Many pages have been further tuned up for phone and tablet screens. For instance, the [dashboard](https://docs.once.to/en/blog/0005/):

## Miscellaneous

There's more:

* We've completed integration with [Stripe payment provider](https://docs.once.to/en/blog/0003/).
* There's now a link to [Trustpilot reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/once.to) on the front page.
* The documentation has been further extended, especially the [Knowledge Base](https://docs.once.to/en/kb/).

Stay with us for even more cool stuff!
