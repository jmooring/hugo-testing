One of the tricky things in Dutch is the mapping of a noun to one of the two grammatical genders:

* **Common**, which is masculine and feminine combined. Such nouns are called {{< fl "de-woorden" >}} because they are prepended by the {{< fl "de" >}} definite article.
* **Neuter**, nouns of which are {{< fl "het-woorden" >}} as you put the {{< fl "het" >}} article before them.

For an English speaker this doesn't make a lot of sense. Why are {{< fl "het document" >}} (document) and {{< fl "het paard" >}} (horse) neuter whereas {{< fl "de wolk" >}} (cloud) and {{< fl "de zon" >}} (sun) common?

There's a number of general rules that facilitate this task, but they only apply in some specific cases. For example, all nouns wearing the diminutive {{< fl "-tje" >}} suffix are neuter. For the rest you'll have to memorise that for each word.

## The het-noun cheat sheet

To simplify the learning a little, I've made a list of most common {{< fl "het" >}}-nouns. You can print it out on an A3 sheet and hang it, say, in the WC.
