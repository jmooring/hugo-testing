**Client SSI Generator** is a complementary tool for web designers. It mimics the SSI server (Server Side Includes) behaviour, but on the client side. It may be used for preprocessing HTML pages in the case there's no SSI service available on the HTTP server, nor is there any more advanced service like CGI, ASP or PHP.

SSI mechanism is quite useful for creating consistent website design. You define templates, which are automatically inserted into pages by the server at specified positions. And if such a service is not available (no SSI support or no server involved in HTML content deliveryâ€”for example, in HTML Help (`.chm`) files), the program can to a certain extent solve this by creating SSI content at the designer's workplace. It is anyway much easier than manually rewrite hundreds of pages when you just need to alter the main menu of the website.
