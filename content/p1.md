You should see the following tags above:

- term = a > b\
  title from term page = a > b (override title)

- term = either/or\
  title from term page = either/or

- term = What's next?\
  title from term page = What's next? (override title)


Note: you cannot create a term page (content/taxonomy/term/_index.md) to correspond with the term "either/or" in either v0.122.0 or v0.123.7.
