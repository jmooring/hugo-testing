  What’s happening in China is really interesting. If we trust their official figures and estimates, the economy was driven by 3 things:
  
  1. Real estate (who’s crashing hard)
  2. Consumer spending (who’s in decline, as their population is not growing and aging)
  3. Exports (who are threatened by India and South East Asia)
