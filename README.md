# Hugo Forum Topic #49627

Details: <https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/49627>

Description: Is there a simple way to display images in hugo?

## Instructions

Clone this branch of the repository and build the site.

```text
git clone --single-branch -b hugo-forum-topic-49627 https://github.com/jmooring/hugo-testing hugo-forum-topic-49627
cd hugo-forum-topic-49627
hugo server
```

And this is a really stupid limitation in Obsidian:

They need to fix that to provide compatibility between Obsidian and VS Code Markdown Preview mode.
